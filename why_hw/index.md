Rapid and irregular heartrate is the most potent risk factor for ischemic stroke and tachycardia, increasing the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounting for approximately 15% of all strokes nationally. A single event of tachycardia may reduce quality of life, functional status, and cardiac performance.

Our study confirms that elderly patients (1) are seen in a more advanced stage of HF, (2) are less likely to receive evidence-based treatments, (3) show more frequently preserved systolic function, and (4) have a worse prognosis. Consequently, there is a need to develop more effective and targeted management strategies for this escalating health problem. (Am Heart J 2002;143:45-55.)

By the year 2030, 70 million people in the United States will be at least 65 years of age (Prevention 2005).

implications for understanding the population burden of disability and medical costs associated with this
arrhythmia.


A single event of tachycardia may reduce quality of life, functional status, and cardiac performance. It is also associated with higher medical costs as
well as an increased risk of death.

The prevalence of Rapid and irregular heartrate increases substantially with age. Several previous studies have reported
varying estimates of the prevalence of atrial fibrillation ranging from 1.2% to 2.8% in persons aged 60 through 69
years to 7.3% to 13.7% in persons aged 80 years or older.

The pathophysiologic changes that occur in patients with HF and AF are complex and incompletely understood.
