Rapid and irregular heartrate is the most potent risk factor for ischemic stroke and tachycardia, increasing the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounting for approximately 15% of all strokes nationally. A single event of tachycardia may reduce quality of life, functional status, and cardiac performance.

Elderly patients are more likely to be hospitalized at a more advanced stage of HF and have a worse prognosis. Furthermore, by year 2030, 70 million people in the United States will be at least 65 years of age. Consequently, there is a need to develop more effective and targeted management strategies for this escalating health problem for a growing vulnerable population.  
<br>
A single event of tachycardia may reduce quality of life, functional status, and cardiac performance. It is also associated with higher medical costs as
well as an increased risk of death.  
<br>
The prevalence of rapid and irregular heartrate increases substantially with age. In addition to the population burden of disability and medical costs associated with tachycardia, the pathophysiologic changes that occur these patients complex and incompletely understood.
