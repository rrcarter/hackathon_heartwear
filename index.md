# Get your loved one the help they need before a medical event happens.
Heart failure (HF) affects almost 5 million patients in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.  
<br>
Rapid and irregular heartrate - otherwise known as tachycardia, like HF, affects millions of patients and markedly increases in prevalence with age.  
<br>
A single tachycardic event may reduce a patient's quality of life, functional status, and may cause permant damange to the muscles of the heart.  As the US population ages, the number of patients afflicted with tachycardia and heart failure will continue to grow.

## Never Miss A Beat.
Harnessing the power of widely availible and fitness trackers, HeartWear connects you to your loved one's heartbeat.  
<br>
With this technology the wearer's heartrate will be monitored around the clock.  Using Google Cloud Messaging and NFC, we can alert you, as your loved one's designated emergency contact, that their heart rate has reached a dangeous level indicative of a tachycardiac event.
